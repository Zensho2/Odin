            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <br><li>1 can of tuna (the kind you have to guard with your life from your cat's relentless pursuit)</li>
            <li>1 luxurious bowl (because nothing but the best will do)</li>
            <li>A dash of love (optional, but highly recommended)</li>
        </div>
        <div class="recipe_element3">
            <h2> Instructions</h2>
            <br><li>1- Begin by delicately opening the can of tuna, taking care to do this in a different room, so your cat doesn’t realize you’re preparing their next meal.</li>
            <br><li>2- Drain the tuna, while your cat watches with laser-focused eyes, convinced you’re about to make them the meal of a lifetime.</li>
            <br><li>3- Flake the tuna into the bowl, arranging it with the care of a fine sushi chef. Remember, presentation is key—even if your cat will devour it in 3 seconds flat.</li>
            <br><li>4- Serve the tuna with a flourish, placing the bowl in your cat’s favorite dining spot, and step back to admire your culinary masterpiece.</li>
            <br><li>5- Watch as your cat devours the tuna, then demands more, reminding you that this is their world, and you’re just living in it..</li>
            <br><li>Bon appétit!</li>
